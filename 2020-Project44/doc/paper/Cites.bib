		 medical applications, especially in cases of expensive
		 measurements of immune biomarkers. This paper describes
		 the problem of logistic regression analysis with the
		 sample size determination algorithms, namely the
		 methods of univariate statistics, logistics regression,
		 cross-validation and Bayesian inference. The authors,
		 treating the regression model parameters as a
		 multivariate variable, propose to estimate the sample
		 size using the distance between parameter distribution
		 functions on cross-validated data sets. Herewith, the
		 authors give a new contribution to data mining and

  abstract =	"In this paper we propose an approach to discover
		 functions for IR ranking from a space of simple
		 closed-form mathematical func-tions. In general, all IR
		 ranking models are based on two basic variables,
		 namely, term frequency and document frequency. Here a
		 grammar for generating all possible functions is
		 defined which consists of the two above said variables
		 and basic mathematical operations -addition,
		 sub-traction, multiplication, division, logarithm,
		 exponential and square root. The large set of functions
		 generated by this grammar is filtered by check-ing
		 mathematical feasibility and satisfiability to
		 heuristic constraints on IR scoring functions proposed
		 by the community. Obtained candidate functions are
		 tested on various standard IR collections and several
		 sim-ple but highly efficient scoring functions are
		 identified. We show that these newly discovered
		 functions are outperforming other state-of-the-art IR
		 scoring models through extensive experimentation on
		 several IR collections. We also compare the performance
		 of functions satisfying IR constraints to those which
		 do not, and show that the former set of func-tions
		 clearly outperforms the latter one 3 .",
